# AI Joke Generator

## Project Description

*I present to you my creation from the **SheCodes** AI workshop—an **AI Joke Generator**. This fun project allows you to ask for jokes with just a click.*

### 1. Key Features

- Crafted with love using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this **single-page** website uses the SheCodes API to generate the jokes.
- The code is **open-soruced** and hosted on Netlify.
- Whether you're on a computer or a mobile device, the website has a responsive design with a clear and modern layout that's easy on the eyes.

### 2. Usage

- Simply fire up your browser, connect to the internet, and voila—no installations needed!
- Hit the *Tell me a nerd joke* button to summon a witty gem from our AI friend.
- Your joke appears beneath the button.
  
> **Pro Tip:** It might take up to 30 seconds for the API magic to work, so let patience be your virtue.

- Feel free to keep the laughter flowing by generating as many jokes as your heart desires.
